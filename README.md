# Polygon_Triangulation

This is my first project and it was made for a competitve exam, to enter in "Grandes Ecoles d'Ingénieur" in France after 2 years of "prépa" which can be translated to an intensive foundation degree.

## Art Gallery Problem

What is the minimum number of guards who together can observe the whole gallery ?
The surface of the gallery is represented by a simple polygon. Art Gallery Theorem : "To guard a simple polygon with 
n vertices, n/3 guards are always sufficient and sometimes necessary".

### Usage




#### Compile
`ocamlfind ocamlc -package graphics -linkpkg Arbre_BR.ml Triangulation.ml Coloriage.ml Affichage.ml`
